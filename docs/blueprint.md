# **App Name**: Bro Chat

## Core Features:

- Slang Response Generation: Buddy responds to user prompts using Groq AI, ensuring answers incorporate slang/casual language and the bot refuses to answer questions about general knowledge, responding as a loveable goofball. Additionally, the bot knows the user's background, interests, and personal details to personalize interactions.
- Personalized Chit-Chat: LLM Tool that dynamically decides when to mention details it knows about the user or about me (the developer) to make conversation more personal and relevant.
- Chat Input: A simple text input field where the user can type questions for the buddy.
- Conversation Display: Display the ongoing conversation clearly and dynamically; User input on the left side and buddy output on the right side.
- Static Webapp: Serve a static webapp; a simple mechanism for running the app.

## Style Guidelines:

- A vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to convey a sense of energy and approachability, reflecting the friendly nature of the 'bro'.
- Light gray (#EEEEEE) to provide a clean and modern backdrop, ensuring the chat messages stand out. This choice is appropriate for a light scheme.
- A complementary purple (#9C27B0), positioned analogously to the blue, adding visual interest while keeping a cohesive and cheerful feel.
- 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for its modern and approachable aesthetic, easy readability, and the touch of warmth and personality in its design.
- Use simple, outline-style icons to represent different types of advice or topics the buddy can suggest.
- Subtle animations for new messages, like a fade-in or slide-in, to provide a dynamic feel.
